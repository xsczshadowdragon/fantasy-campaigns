    <div id="tutorial"
         style="display: flex;
                flex-direction: column;
                align-items: center;
                justify-content: center;">

         <h3>Getting Started</h3>
         <p>The first thing a player will do is join a civilization. If they are a free member they can join a civilization while
         paid members can create custom ones. The next thing a player should do is study the campaign that your civilization is
         currently participating in. Also study the campaign map, it’s territories, and the objective. Every player will create a
         character and give them a name. If a free member’s character dies in battle, they will be ejected from the campaign.
         Paid members can instate an heir if their character dies.</p>

         
         <h3>Movement</h3>
         <p>Moving any unit from region to region takes 5 turns.</p>

         <h3>Turn-based</h3>
         <p>Each player in a campaign gets a turn to spend their resources and perform an action for their civilization. Players
         should enable notifications for the channel so that they will know when other players have finished their turn. The host
         of the campaign will monitor player turns to make sure they are playing. Any player who
         does not perform enough turns in a day will be ejected from the campaign. Every turn a civilization generates money,
         resources, population, and reputation.</p>

         <h3>Civilizations</h3>
         <p>A civilization is comprised of it's ancestry (examples: humans, orcs, elves), it's name, a banner, a leader, and it's
         officers.</p>

         <h3>Ancestries</h3>
         <p>Ancestries are essentially playable races. Included are: Humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, beastkin, forsaken, dryad, and
         draconic. Each ancestry has a unique characteristic so understanding how to play them will help you be strategically
         effective. Players can create civilizations of mixed ancestries. Slight modifications are allowed, for example forsaken
         elves, vampiric humans, or an entire civilization of one animal type if playing beastkin.</p>

         <h3>Roleplay</h3>
         <p>Roleplaying is not required but it is encouraged. Roleplaying adds to the ambiance of the game and helps players stay in
         character and focused on the game.</p>

         <h3>Resources</h3>
         <p>Resources are: Money, Metal, Wood, Stone, Food, and Crystals. Each resource is used in it's own way for building new
         structures, crafting tools/items/weapons/armor, buying services or other materials, trading, and other objective related
         purposes.</p>

         <h3>Population</h3>
         <p>Civilizations need population for soldiers and workers. Building housing increases a settlements population.</p>

         <h3>Reputation</h3>
         <p>Reputation is determined by the morality of a civilizations actions. Breaking treaties, genociding peaceful
         civilizations, and mistreating your population can lead to an evil reputation.</p>

         <h3>Armies</h3>
         <p>Armies are comprised of infantry, ranged infantry, cavalry, and siege equipment. There are also heroes and special
         units. Heroes bolster the attack and defense of an army when they are connected to it. Special units are scouts,
         assassins, diplomats, and guards.</p>

         <h3>Territories</h3>
         <p>Territories are claimed by the civilization that first builds a home base there. Once a territory has been claimed, it's
         resources go to the civilization which has claimed it. Other civilizations can still put structures and armies in that
         territory, though. Other civilizations can also claim your territory by defeating all the military there and waiting 10
         turns.</p>

         <h3>Campaign story, objective, and theme</h3>
         <p>A campaign is comprised of a a story, an objective, and a theme. Common themes are medieval, medieval-fantasy,
        historical reinactment, modern, apocalypse, inter-galactic, and cyberpunk.</p>

         <h3>Battle</h3>
         <p>Battles use a combination of unit stats and dice rolls to determine outcome. A common unit has an attack and hit points.
         To attack an enemy army, you must first know their location. Once you have scouted the enemy, you can then initiate an
         attack. If you move your army into a hostile region and the opponent has a scout in that army, they will be aware of
         your presence and your units.</p>

         <h3>Attack, hit points</h3>
         <p>A unit’s attack is based on it’s dice. For example a basic sword infantry will roll a 1d4. If a player rolls a 3 and the
         enemy unit has 3 hp, the unit will perish.</p>

         <h3>Actions</h3>
         <p>Player actions are submitted to the game manager in the chat. Here is a list of possible actions: buy, sell, trade,
         build, destroy, train unit, attack, hide unit, camp unit, recruit player, promote player, demote player, exile player,
         engage diplomacy, offer gift, offer region, offer money, offer neutral treaty, declare war, offer peace treaty.</p>

                align-items: center;
                justify-content: center;">

         <h3>Switching civilizations</h3>
         <p>Once a player joins a civilization they have a few days to switch if they change their mind. However a player can only
         switch civilizations once per month.</p>
         
         <h3>Cancelling actions</h3>
         <p>When a player performs an action they have have 5 minutes to send a request to the GM to cancel it. If another player
         has already performed an action after yours, you cannot cancel your action.</p>

         <h3>Traitors and Spying</h3>
         <p>If a player is caught giving information about any civ to another civ, the leader of that civilization can choose to
         fine them, imprison them (unable to play for 7 days) or exile them from the civilization. That player will also receive
         a traitor role for 1 month’s duration.</p>
