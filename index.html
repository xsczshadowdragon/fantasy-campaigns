         <h3>Creating a character</h3>
         <p>The first thing a player will do after joining the server is create their character. To do so, choose an ancestry, a
         combat class, and a civilization to join. In the wiki is more information to help you decide how to make your character.</p>

         <h3>Turn-based gameplay</h3>
         <p>The game is played by turns. Each civilization has a turn and every player in that civilization will perform their
         actions. Players should enable notifications for the channel so that they will know when it is their turn. The host of
         the campaign will be available to assist players if need be. Any player who is consistently absent will be ejected from
         the campaign but their character will be saved. Every turn civilizations generates money and resources.</p>

         <h3>Moving armies</h3>
         <p>AFter an army is trained, it will wait in it's respective territory until you choose to invade another territory.
         Invading a territory takes 1 round. In other words, after all the other civilizations have had their turn, your invasion
         will commence.</p>

         <h3>Civilizations</h3>
         <p>A civilization is comprised of it's ancestry (examples: humans, elves, dwarves), it's name, a banner, a leader, and it's
         members. Leaders are elected through votes or assigned by the campaign host.</p>

         <h3>Roleplay</h3>
         <p>Roleplaying is not required but it is encouraged. Roleplaying adds to the ambiance of the game and helps players stay in
         character and focused on the game.</p>

         <h3>Resources</h3>
         <p>Resources are: Money, Metal, Wood, Stone, Food, and Crystals. Each resource is used in it's own way for building new
         structures, crafting tools/items/weapons/armor, buying services or other materials, trading, and other objective related
         purposes. Civilizations accumulate resources by it's buildings and also by player deposits.</p>

         <h3>Population</h3>
         <p>Civilizations need population for soldiers and workers. Building housing increases a settlements population.</p>

         <h3>Armies</h3>
         <p>Armies are trained by military buildings comprised of infantry, ranged infantry, cavalry, siege equipment.</p>

         <h3>Special units</h3>
         <p>Special units are used for tactical purposes. A few examples of special units are scouts, assassins, diplomats, priests, and guards.</p>

         <h3>Territories</h3>
         <p>Territories are claimed by the civilization that first builds a home base there. Once a territory has been claimed, it's
         natural resources go to the civilization which has claimed it. Other civilizations can still put structures and armies
         in that territory. Other civilizations can also claim your territory by defeating all the military there and if remains
         unchallenged for 10 turns will obtain that territory.</p>

         <h3>Battle</h3>
         <p>Battles use a combination of unit stats and dice rolls to determine outcome. A common unit has an attack and hit points.
         To attack an enemy army, you must first know their location. Once you have scouted the enemy, you can then initiate an
         attack. If you move your army into a hostile region and the opponent has a scout in that army, they will be aware of
         your presence and your units.</p>

         <h3>Attack, hit points</h3>
         <p>A unit’s attack is based on it’s dice. For example a basic sword infantry will roll a 1d4. If a player rolls a 3 and the
         enemy unit has 3 hp, the unit will perish.</p>

         <h3>Actions</h3>
         <p>Player actions are submitted in their respective civilization's actions channel. Here is the list of possible actions
         (some of these actions are exclusive to civilization leaders): buy, sell, trade, build, destroy, train unit, attack,
         hide unit, camp unit, recruit player, promote player, demote player, exile player, engage diplomacy, offer gift, offer
         region, offer money, offer neutral treaty, declare war, offer peace treaty.</p>

         <h3>Switching civilizations</h3>
         <p>Once a player joins a civilization they have a few days to switch if they change their mind. However a player can only
         switch civilizations once per month.</p>
         
         <h3>Cancelling actions</h3>
         <p>When a player performs an action they have have 5 minutes to send a request to the GM to cancel it. If another player
         has already performed an action after yours, you cannot cancel your action.</p>

         <h3>Traitors and Spying</h3>
         <p>If a player is caught giving information about any civ to another civ, the leader of that civilization can choose to
         fine them, imprison them (unable to play for 7 days) or exile them from the civilization. That player will also receive
         a traitor role for 1 month’s duration.</p>
